* The goal of this assignment was to create a workday scheduler that would allow the user to save their to-do's.

* The scheduler relies on local storage to display past to-do's.  Another feature is green-red alert notice that shows future time as green, and current time as red for better to-do management.

* jquery was used to create the dynamic buttons that would allow to save info,and also recall if from local storage.

* Unfortunately, my local storage code is not able to retrieve information at the moment.  I will sort this out to make it function.
