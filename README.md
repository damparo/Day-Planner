# Day-Planner

## Project Goal

The goal of this assignment was to create a workday scheduler that would allow the user to save their to-do's.

## Functionality

The scheduler relies on local storage to display past to-do's.  Another feature is green-red alert notice that shows future time as green, and current time as red for better to-do management.

jquery was used to create the dynamic buttons that would allow to save info, and also recall it from local storage.

## Thoughts:

Local storage is functional.
Timeblocks are color coded.

## Update:
No further updates for functionality.
